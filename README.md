# 📈 Stock Market Prediction using LSTM (TensorFlow)

This project builds a machine learning model using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** neural networks to predict stock market closing prices based on historical data.  
It uses **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **yfinance** for fetching and modeling stock data.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Fetch real-time stock data using **yfinance**.
- Preprocess and normalize the data.
- Build an **LSTM-based deep learning model**.
- Train the model to predict future stock prices.
- Visualize the actual vs predicted stock prices.
